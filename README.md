<h1>CompVisCharades</h1>
In this repo, I have included the sourcecode for the prototype of a game called CVCharades.\
This game consists of 2 main mechanics:\
1. The player is given a noun that they must try to disguise themselves as in a webcam\
2. The player is given a score for how well they have disguised themselves, which will be\
    compared against the score their opponents have received for the same task\

<h2>How to run</h2>
1. Clone the repo to your machine\
2. pip install virtualenv to install virtualenv (if not installed already)\
3. virtualenv venv to create your new environment - <ins>ensure it is using python==3.10</ins>\
4. venv/Scripts/activate to enter the virtual environment\
5. pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements in the current virtual environment\
