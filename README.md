<h1>CompVisCharades</h1>
In this repo, I have included the sourcecode for the prototype of a game called CVCharades. <br /> 
This game consists of 2 main mechanics:  <br />
1. The player is given a noun that they must try to disguise themselves as in a webcam  <br />
2. The player is given a score for how well they have disguised themselves, which will be  <br />
    compared against the score their opponents have received for the same task  <br />
  
  
<h2>How to run</h2>
1. Clone the repo to your machine  <br />
2. `pip install virtualenv` to install virtualenv (if not installed already)  <br />
3. `virtualenv venv` to create your new environment - <ins>ensure it is using python==3.10</ins>  <br />
4. `venv/Scripts/activate` to enter the virtual environment  <br />
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements in the current virtual environment  <br />
6. `python predictorv3.py` to run the most recent version of the script
